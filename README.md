# Classification-of-Cancerous-Mole-CanMoc-system-
CanMoC (Cancerous Mole Classifier) is an image classification system that classifies 3 type of cancerous moles which are Melanoma, Nevus and Sebborheic Keratosis based on image of skin spot using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Classification of Cancerous Mole using CNN

1. Data
(some error occured therefore I couldnt upload the dataset, however you can get the dataset from kaggle - 
1. muhakabartay/melanoma-public 2. jaiahuja/skin-cancer-detection)
This folder contains a dataset of images that used for training the classification model which consists of three type of mole; Melanoma, Nevus and Seborrheic Keratosis. The dataset is split to three set; train, valid, and test. 

2. Model
The "Cancerous mole classification.ipynb" file is a python notebook file that consists codes of the model. The model is created by using Python programming language in Jupyter Lab.
Run the file and save the model as .h5 file (eg; experiment1a.h5).

4. Prototype system
The user interface is designed by using streamlit, hence it may require some libraries and packages.
Make sure to include the model file name that you have saved in the code before run.
